# JamulusAudioEngine

Jamulus (https://jamulus.io) is a low-latency open-source audio mixing client-server application.

This package provides the logic for the audio components of working with a 
Jamulus connection in swift, using the AVFoundationAudio and CoreAudio layers

It is very much a work-in-progress at the moment, meaning frequent changes and not entirely functional.

Here be dragons.
